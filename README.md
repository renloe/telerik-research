__Course Description__\
This training course is developed to help you get started with Telerik Reporting set of services and features. It aims to put you in the shoes of a report designer and an engineer that is integrating a reporting solution to an existing application.

In this training we are using ASP.NET Core with Blazor and our job is to add a dynamic report page to a public tracking application that has already been developed. In the course we will design and develop a report using the Telerik Reporting Standalone Report designer. Then, we will incorporate that report into an existing app using the Telerik Report Viewer for Blazor. We will also try different configuration options that come out of the box for Telerik Reporting, like communication between the report server and the web app, as well as hosting the report APIs in the app itself.

What are we learning in this course:

Introduction to Telerik Reporting and the tools to design and preview reports
Installation and package management
Design, creation and integration of reports
Advanced scenarios, like Globalization, Parameters, Exporting, how pass custom UserIdentity object, Rendering and Paging
Styling - Custom styles, Themes and how to reuse style sheets


You will be doing some exercises during the course, so make sure to download the:

RPS Tracker project - version one of the application we will be modifying;\
RPS sample database - this is the DB used for generating the reports
